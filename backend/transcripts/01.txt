hey it's frank here with 4d honeybee and
i'm about to do an inspection on my hive
number one here
now this hive was the first nuke that i
installed this year
and it's looking pretty decent
there's a decent amount of activity i
added a second brood box to it
five days ago and uh it was pretty full
that
at that mark at that mark i found that
five five days ago which was about three
weeks
three and a half weeks since the first
install now it was four and a half weeks
since the first
at the four and a half week mark this
hive was the single box was pretty full
and it had produced one supersedure
cell so i took that cell out
i gave it to a split and actually that
cell formed the new queen in that split
so
there you go its jeans are uh are being
spread
hopefully they're good jeans um so i put
an empty frame in there and i added the
second brood box full of uh
empty frames i think so that this queen
has a lot of room to lay so
i'm gonna do a quick inspection hoping
to see a lot of bees in that upper box
starting to fill it out
and hoping to see how they're doing down
below and thanks for joining me
at 4d honeybee
okay so hopefully the cameras have been
working i've been really having some
camera issues this year
gopro is great but it seems to turn
itself off and on whenever the heck it
feels like
it doesn't give me any warnings so
half the time i don't know whether it's
running or not
and you all know i've been whining about
my main camera up there
because the screen is busted so
yesterday i filmed this hive and it was
fantastic
it was like the almost perfect
inspection
and the camera wasn't running the whole
time so hopefully it's running now okay
let's concentrate here
looking for the queen on the lid do not
see her
decent number of bees up here i found
the queen right up here
yesterday so i expect to find her again
okay this might be a frame that the
queen is on but i believe she was on the
next one over last time
now this side is nice because it's a
good side for laying
let's see if i can see some eggs in here


okay so i'm gonna keep this one in here


looking for the queen on here


okay i don't see her on here and this is
a pretty good frame because it's got
honey
you can have a look here
honey pollen


and no queen
okay so let's just wait i'm gonna take a
look at one more frame i'd really like
to find the queen before i shake any
more bees into that hive


ugh


so far no smoking it's been okay these
bees are amazing
but this hive will start to roar soon


so these two frames go back in
because they're in pretty good shape and
they're
gonna be really easy for the queen to
build out
see that they're already practically
built out
lighter frame
it's the perfect frame for laying


it's got the honey all around it and
then a big open space in the middle and
you can see
there's the queen beautiful beautiful
queen right there
see here near the bottom
what a beautiful queen
okay now what the gopro is not
agreeing so


where'd she go oh there she is right at
the top of the frame now
see right there
now it's at the bottom of the frame
walking towards my left right by the
wood
beautiful queen i'm going to get her
back in don't want to distress it too
much rocking right towards my right
finger there
now down towards the bottom of the frame
okay i'm going to put her in that was a
perfect frame for her to be on
because it was


it was uh had great resources around the
sides and just opened for her in the
middle and she was
laying eggs so that's all i wanted i
wanted to find the queen
and now i have so i'm going to put this
hive back together and i'm going to ask
you for some help
i want to name these hives i don't want
to distress you too much rocking right
towards my right finger there now down
towards the bottom of the frame okay i'm
going to put her in
that was a perfect frame for her to be
on
because it was


it was uh had great resources around the
sides and just
opened for her in the middle and she was
laying eggs so
that's all i wanted i wanted to find the
queen
and now i have so i'm going to put this
hive back together and i'm going to ask
you for some help
i want to name these hives names have
sort of
come naturally or accidentally for me so
i'm going to give you a couple of
characteristics
of the hives and i'd love for you guys
to give me some names
and then i'll choose one and maybe i'll
send a little gift to someone if uh if i
can find something i'm sure i got
something kicking around that would be
of use
so this hive the clean queen flew away
as soon as i installed the hive as soon
as i installed the nuke she flew right
away off the bottom frame
as i was transferring her to the box now
i think they
remade a queen and that queen is in
there
and just laying like crazy she's doing
amazing
so what do we call this hive the fly
away hive the new queen hive the i don't
know
what but let me know what you think
they're doing really well
i added a second supersedure just
after week number four
and they show no signs of slowing down
so um give me a name for this hive
and then as i work toward the next hives
next hives are kind of
messed up because it's just one hive
that seems to be re-queening or wanting
to re-queen
and then i've got two splits on the go
right now so
uh we'll name those later but for now if
you can give me a name for this hive
i'd really appreciate it so
i don't know maybe i'm getting better at
finding the queen i seem to be spotting
her almost every time now so
that's it for this inspection it was a
quickie
because it was just really part two and
hopefully i can put it together with
yesterday's video uh which was all gopro
because this silly camera failed until i
got a new one that's gonna be something
i have to work with
and uh so i just finished it today found
the queen no sign of storming huge
numbers of bees lots of laying lots of
brood fantastic hive
i may need to be putting a honey super
on this in a week or so
so i need to be ready for that so that's
it uh
spl two splits are done one hive is iffy
don't know if there's a queen in it
so i'll be back at these hives next week
and thanks for joining me at 40 honeybee
